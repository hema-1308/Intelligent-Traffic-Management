## Intelligent Traffic Management
This GitHub project demonstrates an intelligent traffic management system with adaptive traffic light control and smart parking. The system aims to reduce traffic congestion and improve parking efficiency in urban areas by using real-time data to dynamically adjust traffic light timings and guide drivers to available parking spots.

# Project Overview
The intelligent traffic management system includes two key components: adaptive traffic light control and smart parking.

## Adaptive Traffic Light Control:
This feature uses real-time vehicle detection to adjust traffic light timings at intersections. By giving green lights to lanes with the highest vehicle count, the system reduces waiting times and minimizes congestion.
## Smart Parking:
This component uses sensors to detect and display available parking spots. It aims to reduce parking-related congestion by guiding drivers to open parking spaces, reducing the time spent searching for parking.
Technology Stack
# Programming Languages: Python
Libraries/Frameworks: OpenCV (for vehicle detection), [Other Libraries if applicable]

## Future Enhancements
We plan to expand the intelligent traffic management system with additional features:

# Integration with Smart City Infrastructure:
Connect the system with broader smart city networks for enhanced traffic management.
# Mobile Application for Drivers:
Develop a mobile app to guide drivers to available parking spots and provide real-time traffic updates.
# Machine Learning for Traffic Pattern Prediction:
Use machine learning techniques to predict traffic patterns and optimize traffic light control.
